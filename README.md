Week 1
Since I have no experience with app development and have never worked with Swift, I chose to watch the "100 Days of SwiftUI" video series, covering days 1 to 7. It took me a few hours to learn and understand the basic operations of Swift, but it has been very helpful in getting started with Swift programming.

For this week's assignment, I referred to the sample playground for further ideas on how to work with emojis. I chose to create a simple drawing of a house using emojis. A small house will appear on the playground's bottom screen when the ▶️ button is pressed. Since this project is a simple first try at Swift programming, I didn't encounter any difficulties that I couldn’t solve. This has been a good start for me!
